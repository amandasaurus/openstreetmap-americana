The purpose of the Americana style is to:

- Express the American experience through cartography
- Challenge the status quo by showcasing innovation and invention
- Promote collaboration and common purpose in the American mapping community

## Contributor's Guide

_Contributors welcome!_

The repository is organized as follows:

- **style/** - The map style. See [Style Contributor's Guide](style/CONTRIBUTE.md)
- _Coming soon! Other customized parts of the tech stack._

Some general guidelines:

- Please follow the coding style guidelines described in each sub-folder. These guidelines are designed to make it easier for collaboration and reduce the chance of edit conflicts.
- Innovation is encouraged! Please open a new ticket with your great ideas as a centralized focal point for discussion.
- New contributors are welcome!
- This style operates on the principle of consensus. Maintainers should ensure that changes represent a broad consensus within the American mapping community.
- Maintainers are also responsible to ensure that this principle of consensus does not cause stagnation or inaction. Contributor time is valuable; accepting the responsibility of being a maintainer means committing to responding to issues and PRs on a reasonable timeline that encourages community participation.

## Technology Stack

The technology stack for this style can be summarized below:

Some notes:

- This style currently consists of the stylesheets alone, and relies on the MapTiler Cloud service, however, we hope to migrate to a self-hosted vector tile server that would allow us to customize the tiles, integrate other technologies, and optimize the size of served vector tiles.
- SVG icons are converted into a png sprite sheet which is parsed by the mapLibre front-end.
